# Layout Changes

A layout change happens when an element on the page changes position in a way that affects other elements on the page. For example, changing the width or height of an element is a layout change because any neighbouring element has to move to make room for the element's new size:

- hey
- hey
- you
- you

# Animating With CSS

So how would we animate layout changes? One way is by animating the property directly using something like CSS transitions:

To be honest, in many cases, we can end the post here!

But there are two main downsides with CSS animations that we should be aware of:

1. You can't animate everything. For example, you can't animate a change in justify-content because justify-content is not an animatable property.
2. There may be a performance trade-off. CSS animations that involve layout changes are generally more expensive than transform-based animations, so you might find that your animations are not as smooth on lower-end devices.

Let's talk about the performance problem for a second.
