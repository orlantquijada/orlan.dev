title: Hope and Fear Are the Same
author: Seneca
book: Moral Letters
section: 5.7b-8
quote: >
  Hecato says, 'cease to hope and you will cease to fear.'...The primary cause of both these ills is that instead of adapting ourselves to present circumstances we send out thoughts too far ahead.

Hope is generally regarded as good. Fear is generally regarded as bad. To a Stoic like Hecato (known as Hecato of Rhodes), they are the sameâ€”both are projections into the future about things we do not control. Both are the enemy of this present moment that you are actually in. Both mean you're living a life in opposition to _amor fati_.

It's not about overcoming our fears but understanding that both hope and fear contain a dangerous amount of _want_ and _worry_ in them. And, sadly, the want is what causes the worry.
