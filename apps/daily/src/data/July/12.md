title: Some Simple Rules
author: Marcus Aurelius
book: Meditations
section: '8.51'
quote: >
  In your actions, don't procrastinate. In your conversations, don't confuse. In your thoughts, don't wander. In your soul, don't be passive or aggressive. In your life, don't be all about business.

Simple is rarely easy. But now that you have these rules, make it your duty to put them into practiceâ€”with the first item on your to-do list, with the first conversation you have, with your soul, and, of course, with the life you make for yourself. Not just today, but every day.

Write that on the blackboard and don't forget it.
