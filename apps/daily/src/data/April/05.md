One of the wonders of your mind is the quickness with which it can comprehend and categorize things. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in _Blink_, we are constantly making split-second decisions based on years of experience and knowledge as well as using the same skill to confirm prejudices, stereotypes, and assumptions. Clearly, the former thinking is a source of strength, whereas the latter is a great weakness.

We lose very little by taking a beat to consider our own thoughts. _Is this really so bad?_ _What do I really know about this person?_ _Why do I have such strong feelings here?_ _Is anxiety really adding much to the situation?_ _What's so special about \_\_\_\_\_?_
