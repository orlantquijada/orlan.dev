author: Marcus Aurelius
book: Meditations
section: '7.4'
quote: >
  Pay close attention in conversation to what is being said, and to what follows from any action. In the action, immediately look for the target, in words, listen closely to what's being signaled.

Through the work of the psychologist Albert Ellis, Stoicism has reached millions of people through what's known as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). As a form of therapy, CBT helps patients identify destructive patterns in their thoughts and behavior so they can, overtime, direct and influence them in a more positive direction.

Of course, Marcus Aurelius had no formal training in psychology, but his words here are as important as any doctor's. He's asking you to become an observer of your own thoughts and the actions those thoughts provoke. Where do they come from? What biases do they contain? Are they constructive or destructive? Do they cause you to make mistakes or engage in behavior you later regret? Look for patterns; find where cause meets effect.

Only when this is done can negative behavior be broken; only then can real life improvements be made.
