title: Set the Standards and Use Them
author: Epictetus
book: Discourses
section: 2.11.23-25
quote: >
  When the standards have been set, things are tested and weighed. And the work of philosophy is just this, to examine and uphold the standards, but the work of a truly good person is in using those standards when they know them.

We go through our days responding and reacting, but it's rare to really pause and ask: _Is this thing I'm about to do consistent with what I believe?_ Or better: _Is this the kind of thing the person I would like to be should do?_

The work of living is to set standards and then _not_ compromise them. When you're brushing your teeth, choosing your friends, losing your temper, falling in love, instructing your child, or walking your dog—all of these are opportunities.

Not, _I want to do good_—that's an excuse. But _I will do good in this particular instance, right now_. Set a standard; hold fast to it. That's all there is.
