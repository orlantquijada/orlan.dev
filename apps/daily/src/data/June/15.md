Why do the wise have so few problems compared with the rest of us? There are a few simple reasons.

First, the wise seem to manage expectations as much as possible. They rarely expect what isn't possible in the first place.

Second, the wise always consider both the best and worst case scenarios. They don't just think about what they _wish_ to happen, but also what very realistically _can_ happen if things were to suddenly turn.

And if you follow it today, you too will find that nothing surprises you or happens contrary to your expectations.
