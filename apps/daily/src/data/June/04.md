  Why then are we offended? Why do we complain? This is what we're here for.

No one said life was easy. No one said it would be fair.

Don't forget, though, that you come from a long, unbroken line of ancestors who survived unimaginable adversity, difficulty, and struggle. It's their genes and their blood that run through your body right now. Without them, you wouldn't be here.

You're an heir to an impressive tradition—and as their viable offspring, you're capable of what they are capable of. You're meant for this. Bred for it.

Just something to keep in mind if things get tough.
