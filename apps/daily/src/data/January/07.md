title: Seven Clear Functions of the Mind
author: Epictetus
book: Discourses
section: 4.11.6-7
quote: >
  The proper work of the mind is the exercise of choice, refusal, yearning, repulsion, preparation, purpose and seent. What then can pollute and clog the mind's proper functioning? Nothing but its own corrupt decisions.

Let's break down each one of those tasks:

> Choice—to do and think right<br/>Refusal—of temptation<br/>Yearning—to be better<br/>Repulsion—of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn't true<br/>Preparation—for what lies ahead or whatever may happen<br/>Purpose—our guiding principle and highest priority<br/>Assent—to be free of deception about what's inside and outside our control (and be ready to accept the latter)

This is what the mind is here to do. We must make sure it does—and see everything else as pollution or a corruption.
