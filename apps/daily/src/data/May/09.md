quote: >
  Let us therefore set out whole-heartedly, leaving aside our many distractions and exert ourselves in this single purpose, before we realize too late the swift and unstoppable flight of time and are left behind. As each day arises, welcome it as the very best day of all, and make it your own possession. We must seize what flees.

You will only get one shot at today. You have only twenty-four hours with which to take it. And then it is gone and lost forever. Will you fully inhabit all of today? Will you call out, "I've got this," and do your very best to be your very best?

What will you manage to make out of today before it slips from your fingers and becomes the past? When someone asks you what you did yesterday, do you really want the answer to be "nothing"?
