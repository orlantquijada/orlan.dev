title: Good and Evil? Look at Your Choices
author: Epictetus
book: Discourses
section: 2.16.1
quote: >
  Where is Good? In our reasoned choices. Where is Evil? In our reasoned choices. Where is that which is neither Good or Evil? In the things outside of our own reasoned choice.

Today, as things happen and you find yourself wondering what they all meanâ€”as you find yourself contemplating various decisions, remember: the right thing to do always comes from our reasoned choice. Not whether something is rewarded. Not whether something will succeed, but whether it is the right _choice_.

Epictetus's dictum helps us cut through all this with clarity and confidence. Is something good or bad? Is this right or wrong?

Ignore everything else. Focus only on your choices.
